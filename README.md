# Caesar Cipher

A simple program in python that creates the Caesar cipher.

## Description

The Caesar cipher is an ancient algorithm that encrypts letter by shifting them over a certain number of places in the alphabet.  The actual length of the shift is called the "key." This program allows users to encrypt or decrypt using the Caesar cipher while also allowng the selection of the key ( 0 - 25).

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python 3, pyperclip


## What I Learned
* Basic encryption algorithm
* Good use of for loops, while loops, and multiple instances of embedded loops.
